# Video Quality Inference from Encrypted Traffic

In this lab, you will work through the steps required to create an quality inference model for video streaming services solely relying on encrypted traffic. The lab is split into two exercises (one notebook each):

1. [Extracting features from network traffic](pcap_processing.ipynb): in this notebook you will learn how to create the input features necessary to feed the inference model.
2. [Inferring video resolution from encrypted traffic](feature_importance.ipynb): in this notebook you will learn how to create an actual inference model from a realistic dataset.
